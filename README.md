-   the way of reasoning (i.e. the way of obtaining the result is very important, rather than just the result)
-   the way of organizing work on a feature

## Expected work

-   code should be clean (Latest ECMA syntax, safe Typescript, layer separation)
-   documentation files should be added (How to setup, test, run, etc ...)
-   comments in code could be added when you need to clarify a design decision or assumptions about the spec

## Nice to have

-   tests (Show your best skills : TDD, unit, integration and more)

## Guidelines

- [duplicate](https://help.github.com/articles/duplicating-a-repository/) this repository (do **not** fork it)
-   **commit often and atomically** to show the evolution of the code step by step

## ToDo App

-   A user can create, edit or delete a ToDo list
-   Each ToDo list can contain one or many items
-   Each ToDo list item has a title and a description
-   The title is required, the description is optional
